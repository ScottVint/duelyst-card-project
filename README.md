# ITSD Card Game 2025-26

A simplified single-player browser-based tactical card game inspired by **Duelyst**, built as part of the IT+ Masters Team Project (COMPSCI5074M) at the University of Glasgow.

The human player (Player 1) competes against an AI opponent (Player 2) on a 9×5 grid board, using a deck of cards to summon units, cast spells, and defeat the enemy avatar.

## How to Run

> **Java 21 users:** The project includes a `.sbtopts` file that automatically passes the required `--add-opens` flags to the JVM. No additional configuration is needed.

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd duelyst-card-project
   ```

2. **Place frontend assets** — copy `public/js/` and `public/css/` into the `public/` directory (gitignored; obtain from the project template assets package).

3. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   ./sbt run
   ```
   The first run will download all dependencies automatically. This may take a few minutes.

4. **Open the game in your browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:9000/game
   ```

5. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   ./sbt test
   ```

## Game Rules Summary

- **Board**: 9 columns x 5 rows. Both players have an avatar unit placed on the board.
- **Avatars**: Player 1 starts at tile [2,3]; Player 2 starts at tile [8,3]. Each avatar has 20 HP.
- **Turn order**: Draw a card at end of turn -> spend mana to play cards / move / attack -> end turn.
- **Mana**: Starts at 2 on Player 1's first turn; increases by 1 each turn (max 9). All unspent mana is lost at end of turn.
- **Movement**: Up to 2 tiles in cardinal directions, or exactly 1 tile diagonally per turn. Cannot move through other units.
- **Attack**: Adjacent tiles only (including diagonals). Surviving defenders counter-attack.
- **Summoning**: Unit cards must be placed on a tile adjacent to a friendly unit already on the board.
- **Win condition**: Reduce the enemy avatar to 0 HP.

## Architecture Notes

- Communication between the Java back-end and the browser front-end is **asynchronous** over
  WebSocket. Never block the event thread waiting for a front-end response.
- All game state is held in `GameState`, which is passed into every event handler.
- Use `BasicCommands` to send render commands to the front-end; use `BasicObjectBuilders`
  to construct game objects from their JSON config files.
- The card and unit configs in `conf/gameconfs/` are read-only template files and must not
  be modified.
